# MAP Violation Monitoring System

## Overview

The MAP Violation Monitoring System is a web application designed to monitor Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policy violations across multiple online retailer websites. The application utilizes AI agents to scrape product listings, detect prices below the Manufacturerâ€™s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), and display violations on a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features

- Real-time scraping of product listings
- AI-driven price extraction and validation
- Detection of MAP violations with severity levels
- Simple API for accessing products and violations
- Built-in monitoring and logging

## Architecture

### Core Setup

- **Node.js/TypeScript**: The application is built using Node.js and TypeScript for type safety and scalability.
- **Supabase**: Used for database management and authentication.
- **Clerk**: Handles user authentication via JWT.
- **OpenRouter**: Utilized for AI processing tasks.
- **Bright Data MCP**: Employed for scraping product listings.

### Database Design

The application uses a simplified database design with the following core tables:

- **Products**: Stores product details including name, brand, MAP price, and category.
- **Listings**: Contains retailer-specific product listings with their last scraped prices.
- **Violations**: Logs detected violations with relevant details.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /products**: List all products with current violations.
- **POST /scrape/:productId**: Trigger an immediate scrape for a specific product.
- **GET /violations**: Retrieve the current violations.
